Creating handwritten 8s, removing noise and filling the images, upsampling

This repository features the following:
First of all, the creation of handwritten 8s using the normal distribution.

After that, I handled the data by adding noise and removing the last 400 pixels, I remade each handwritten 8 and removed the noise.

Lastly, I downsampled the image to 7x7 and returned to the original image.
